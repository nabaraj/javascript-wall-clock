# javascript-wall-clock

javascript wall clock using pure javascript, CSS and HTML

To start the JavaScript wall clock, follow these steps:
To compile Sass using npm, you can run the following command in your terminal:

1. ```
   npm install
   ```

2. ```
   npm run sass
   ```

This command will execute the script defined in your `package.json` file, which should be //responsible for running the Sass compiler and generating the CSS output.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
4. The wall clock should automatically start ticking and displaying the current time.

That's it! You have successfully started the JavaScript wall clock.
